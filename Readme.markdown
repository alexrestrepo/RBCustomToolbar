It was far more useful back in the day when RB didn't provide native toolbars ;)

An OSX-style toolbar, useful when you want to have a consistent toolbar in your cross-platform applications, it has some of the features available in OSX native toolbars like button reordering, although given the buffered nature of OSX the reordering animation looks a lot better in Windows.
